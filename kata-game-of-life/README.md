# kata-game-of-life
 My attempt to make a CLI playable simulation of John Conway's Game of Life. Inspired by Coding Dojo Kata found [here](http://codingdojo.org/kata/GameOfLife/).

## To Run this CLI

1. Download and unzip
1. Open /bin/life_game.rb from terminal (you'll need Ruby installed)

## Version Notes

### Push 0.2 

 * Still not playable
 * Working on Grid initialization, especially row/column labeling

### Initial Commit 0.1

 * Not playable yet
 * Setting up classes
 * Next up: Do I make a big array of Cells?
