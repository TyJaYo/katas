# kata-number-to-lcd
Coding Dojo Kata about translating numbers to a multi-line display, then adapting that code. The description of that is [here](https://gist.github.com/arikfr/11362378#file-gistfile1-txt). There are two parts, and I have only done the first.

## To Run this CLI

1. Download and unzip
1. Open /bin/number_to_lcd.rb from terminal (you'll need to [install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/))

## Version Notes

### 1.2 "Fun" (Current)

* Numbers print gradually, line by line

### 1.1 "Fault Tolerance"

* Input now checks itself so it won't wreck itself

### 1.0 "Working Fragile"

* It works!
* It's still pretty fragile
* Methods could be abstracted/simplified
* Input needs fault handling
